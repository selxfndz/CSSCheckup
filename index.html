        <h3>Why Attack on Titan is my Favorite Anime</h3>
        <p>The reason for which Attack on Titan is my favorite anime is because the plot is so unpredictable. The characters develope so nicely, I immediatly adored so many right from the start. AOT is extremely well written and deserves alot of recongnition. The whole idea of the anime show in general is just very out of the box. This show always keeps me on my toes and the animation is honestly so so good in the first 3 seasons!</p>
